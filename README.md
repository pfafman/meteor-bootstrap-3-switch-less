meteor-bootstrap-3-switch-less
==============================

[Bootstrap 3 Switch](http://www.bootstrap-switch.org), packaged for Meteor using less. Currently at 3.3.2

### Install

You have to edit your smart.json and install this the old way with meteorite.

Add the following into a __.less file somewhere in your site

```
@import "packages/pfafman:bootstrap-switch-less/lib/less/build.import.less";
```

Maybe this will change at some point to clean this up...
